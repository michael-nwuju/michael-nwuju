### Prolific Full Stack Engineer, Head of Engineering

👋 Hi, I’m Michael Nwuju — the Prolific Full Stack Engineer.

With 4+ years of experience building and leading production-ready software (including a year as Head of Engineering), I specialize in React, GraphQL, NestJS & MongoDB, shipping scalable systems that deliver real business value.

From designing clean backend architectures to crafting intuitive frontend flows, I bring technical depth, product sense, and a bias for shipping. I’ve led fast-paced teams, owned critical features, and solved real-world problems at scale.
